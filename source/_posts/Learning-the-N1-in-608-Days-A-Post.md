It was 608 days ago (7th September 2020) that I purchased Genki 1 to begin learning Japanese. I had no prior knowledge of the language, and was a monolingual native English speaker, like many beginner learners. Before the book arrived, I took the time to learn Hiragana and Katakana with an application I now no longer remember the name of, and began using the textbook from then onward. Today, I finished learning all content laid out by the N1 syllabus, and all the lower tiers of JLPT. Here's some reflections I've had about the process, what specifically I did with the time, and what I'm hoping to do in the future.

Before that though, I do want to preface; this isn't going to be a "do what I did, and you can complete the N1 syllabus in 5 days and 8 minutes!" style post, nor is it meant to be any sort of advice towards learners of Japanese who are in a similar position that I have been. This post is simply a personal reflection of the time I've spent learning the language, and the parts I particularly enjoyed from that process. Different methods work better for different people, and those "get-rich quick" sort of posts - frankly - kind of suck.

## The Good
### The Obvious One
To be honest, the thing I've most enjoyed during studying up to this point has been learning about and using SRS (Spaced Repetition). I know that's probably the most predictable, boring example you could give, but that's the truth. Prior to this I had no experience using memory tools or techniques, and if I needed to remember something  would just go over the material a fair few hundred times, slowly rote memorising it into my skull until it had sufficiently sunk in (I have remaining PTSD of doing this for hours on Pi day in 2015).

Utilising tools like Anki and its contemporaries has made memorising information a non-issue; take your pick - JPDB, Wanikani, et cetera, they all serve the same function, and without them I wouldn't have been able to get remotely near the amount of content learned as I have now. For a proper overview of how much I consumed from SRS, you can have a look at the [article I wrote at 1½ years into learning](../1-5-Years-of-Learning-A-Retrospective), but as a point of reference my current deck count is 10891 cards.

I've also progressively become better at using SRS tools over time, be that subconsciously or not. Now I can not only retain more information from using the SRS, but also retain that SRS information better than I could when I started using it. This is also pointed out in the statistics section of my previous article (see above), but I thought it was worth pointing out. The benefits from these types of systems are seriously impressive.

### Language Exchange Servers
I've also spent a considerable chunk of my time studying in a few different Discord language exchange servers (English ⇋ Japanese, that is). These have been a pretty fun experience to take part in, although I will say that with a few caveats. I didn't really use these servers to ask study questions or get advice on things that I was stuck on during my study, although that is one aspect of why these servers exist; my use case was essentially just to speak in the "Japanese Only" channels and get some "インターネット世間話" experience.

For just casually conversing in the language and getting a feel for how people speak and behave in online chat rooms in Japanese, these types of chat servers are a very useful tool in my opinion. The other aspects of these servers can be useful to learners that want to have a community sense of study, but for me the restricted "JP only" channels were very useful to get acquainted with the style and atmosphere of the generic online discourse. 

What I *was* careful to avoid, however, was participating in discussions that only contained other intermediate learners speaking the language. As (genuinely) nice as it is to talk with fellow 学習者, there's always the Catch-22 that doing this and not paying due vigilance might result in your adoption of some odd phrases or manners of speaking, in the worst case just plain grammatically incorrect nonsense. Getting stuck in the microcosm is a real issue with places like this, and something I tried my best to avoid.

### The Study Process™

### Reading for Fun and Profit
Fairly late into the learning process, around when I was finishing studying N2 content, I started reading normal novels instead of using manga and online "Graded Reader" style resources, as I felt I'd got to the point where I wouldn't have my brain fall out from attempting to read some real prose, in theory. Since that point, which was about 5 months ago (I began at the start of January), my reading comprehension skills and kanji recognition have massively improved compared to when I was reading less "heavy" written content. That shouldn't really be a surprise to me, and yet it was (and still is!).

I'll state the obvious here, but books are, in general, the most dense form of written language, and like all other forms of media have their own domain of vocabulary and set of tropes. Since they cover a vast variety of topics, ranging from ancient to new to the completely-nonexistant-in-real-life, an eye-wateringly massive span of information is contained within their domain. This isn't to say that other domains like news articles, manga and light novels aren't incredibly useful for learning to read - quite the opposite - but in my opinion books are the optimal choice for improving at reading in general. Yes - I'm aware that this is a pretty obvious conclusion to come to, but I wanted to state it explicitly, because...

Compared to other very "dense" forms of written media like news articles or blog posts, books are actually *fun* to read, at least personally. That's not to say that I don't enjoy those other types of text - on occasion, a blog post on an interesting topic will catch my eye, and I'll read through an article or two of news to catch up on what's going on in the world (although that's getting progressively *less* fun as time goes on). The problem that I find with these types of media are that I can't engage with them for a larger span of time, say, in the hours. Whether this is due to a destroyed attention span, or just that I don't personally engage with that sort of content very well, I can't seem to keep my brain from wandering off when reading them for too long.

Books, however, are a different story. I can happily read a book for three, five hours at a time and still be interested in what's going on. Obviously, if the book is horrifically boring, then this isn't the case, but that's a choice issue and not something wrong with the medium. In addition, reading them doesn't feel like doing "productive work" or studying at all, when in reality it's the polar opposite - you're refreshing your memory on every word that comes up in the text, and learning new ones from context as you go along. To me, this feels like I found something forbidden - I feel like I'm putting in zero work whatsoever, however it's an incredibly useful study tool and has massively helped my reading ability.

The content of this section in particular might be blatantly obvious to anyone who already enjoys reading in their native language, but as someone who took a break from reading any fiction for a number of years before picking up Japanese, it was a nice surprise.
