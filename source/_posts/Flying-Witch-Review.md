最近”ふらいんぐうぃっち”というアニメを見ていて、今日は砕けたな批評するつもりですね。そのアニメでは、真琴が青森県まで引っ越す魔女で親戚と暮らすことにした。居候になる後はたくさん日常の魔女のことしたり下らない問題をかいけつしたり、親戚と遊んだり。とてものんびりのペースがあって本当に平気なきがした。

A while ago, I watched "ふらいんぐうぃっち", and in this post I'll try and give a casual review of it from a language learning perspective, as someone trying to learn primarily from immersion. In the show, you follow Makoto, a witch who has recently moved to Aomori prefecture from the big city to live as a lodger with her relatives. 

To preface, the level I was at when I watched this show was somewhere around the N3 area. I'd just finished "上級への扉" (Tobira) and used this show as the starting point into immersion of natural Japanese speech. I'd previously been listening to podcasts like "日本語コンてっぺい", but this was my first anime used when I'd dropped down my textbook time and started using purely normal, non-education focused Japanese content to learn the language.

The show revolves around Makoto performing everyday witching tasks, solving minor problems around their local area, and exploring and generally having a good time with her relatives, Kei and Chinatsu.

Language-wise, the dialogue in the show is quite simple, and almost entirely consists of everyday phrases and vocabulary. There are some domain-specific language for witch related items (to be expected in a show about one), however these are fairly few and far between, and are often repeated. In terms of raw difficulty, I'd agree with [JPDB's rating](https://jpdb.io/anime/1491/flying-witch) of a 2/10. Bear in mind that the JPDB scale seems to be very bottom heavy, and they don't often assign high numbers. For reference, there are currently only four shows which have been awarded a score of 10/10, ever.

Throughout the twelve episode runtime, the show is quite a slow paced and relaxed affair. There's no real drama, apart from some minor problems that Makoto and friends come across, all of which are resolved within an episode of their reveal. This might be a turn-off for some people, but I enjoyed the chill and relaxed atmosphere of the show, and it was a nice experience to watch through and pick up words from what is mostly just normal, everyday conversation. There are some episodes that focus more on the "witching" aspect of the premise, however these are not devoid of useful everyday language to learn, at least at the level I went into it at.

I would say that if you're expecting a story arc with a satisfying beginning, climax and ending then you won't find that here. The anime ends quite abruptly after what feels like an average episode of the show, and that's how it feels like it's designed to be. It's a "slice of life" in the most literal sense, you get dropped in to shadow this main character for a period of time, and then when the show's runtime is over, you're pulled back out of it. That isn't to say that there is no progression within "ふらいんぐうぃっち", though. Various characters in the show do go through their own small arcs of progression, which I won't spoil completely in this review, it's just the overarching plot as a whole which seems to stay static for the duration.

Overall, I enjoyed "ふらいんぐうぃっち" as a light and easy entrypoint into immersion in native content, and would recommend it to others who are thinking of starting their immersion journey with an easier show. For learners who are slightly more advanced, however (we're talking "has already watched a few shows"), using this for learning you might find that there isn't much challenging language to be found anywhere in the show, barring the witch-related language featured in some episodes. This is the tradeoff made for this being a great show for beginners, but if you're a more advanced learner, I would skip this one if you're purely looking for some extra vocab.
