最近”ふらいんぐうぃっち”というアニメを見ていて、今日は砕けたな批評するつもりですね。そのアニメでは、真琴が青森県まで引っ越す魔女で親戚と暮らすことにした。居候になる後はたくさん日常の魔女のことしたり下らない問題をかいけつしたり、親戚と遊んだり。とてものんびりのペースがあって本当に平気なきがした。

Recently, I watched "Flying Witch", and in this post I'll try and give a casual review of it from a language learning perspective, as someone trying to learn primarily from immersion. In the show, you follow Makoto, a witch who has recently moved to Aomori prefecture from the big city to live as a lodger with her relatives. 

The show revolves around Makoto performing everyday witching tasks, solving minor problems around their local area, and exploring and generally having a good time with her relatives, Kei and Chinatsu.

Language-wise, the dialogue in the show is quite simple, and almost entirely consists of everyday phrases and vocabulary. There are some domain-specific language for witch related items (to be expected in a show about one), however these are fairly few and far between, and are often repeated. In terms of raw difficulty, I'd agree with [JPDB's rating](https://jpdb.io/anime/1491/flying-witch) of a 2/10. Bear in mind that the JPDB scale seems to be very bottom heavy, and they don't often assign high numbers.
