As I write this, I have just started studying using Shinkanzen Master N1 (新完全マスターN1), after having finished the N2 series (and learning that the JLPT exams in the UK are cancelled this year - again!), and was reminded as I went to buy my new textbooks that it has been just under a year and a half since I ordered my copy of Genki 1, and just about one and a half years since I began considering studying Japanese at all. With this in mind, I thought it might be a good time to reflect on what I've learnt so far, what resources I've used, things I enjoyed, and what I would do differently if I could start again from scratch. There have been a million posts on this subject before me, and there will probably be millions after, so take this as one experience and opinion in a sea of many (probably more qualified) opinions!

Before we get to the hard stats, I'll chronologically walk through what resources and methods I used through my learning process, and whether they ended up working out for me personally or not. Beginning with possibly one of the most ubiquitous beginner series out there—

## Genki
![](/images/retrospective-1.png)

Knowing quite literally nothing about the language other than it's native name, I ordered Genki 1 after a mildly thorough Google expedition to find recommended Japanese textbooks for absolute beginners like myself.  A countless number of sites, videos and podcasts will recommend Genki the premier beginner resource for people starting with Japanese - and I can't say I disagree. Coming from someone who, bearing in mind, does enjoy using textbooks in daily life, it was an easy transition to make into starting a regular, consistent study schedule, rather than relying on app notifications or daily quotas to try and keep me motivated.

I had previously tried using Duolingo and Busuu to learn an unrelated language a few years prior to picking up Genki, and my experience with them was very mixed. As many others before me have noted, Duolingo's general course structure for Japanese, and quite a few of it's other community-sourced languages, were severely lacking at the time that I was an active user (although I can't speak for the present day). In addition to this, the lone fact that sites and apps like these are on a mobile platform, which may be a great benefit to some, was most certainly not to me. Distraction is all too easy when you can simply double tap the home row and disappear into any of the other apps you have open, and studying isn't exactly the most thrilling activity in the world, no matter how dedicated you are to your study. Having a physical textbook like Genki was certainly of great use to me, as it meant I could disconnect from everything else I had going on, sit down, and just study for an hour. 

As for the actual contents of the textbook, they were actually surprisingly interesting for what I had assumed would be a fairly classroom-style dry tome of a textbook. There's a consistent set of characters which interact with each other and progress a story (even if completely mundane), as well as a cheerful (you could say 元気, har har) set of illustrations that genuinely did increase my enjoyment of the book over my time with it. The explanations of grammar points were also quite easy to understand and pick up, as an English native speaker anyway, although their explanations of the passive and causative forms was quite poor, and is one gripe I carry with me to this day as it led me to a fair few misunderstandings down the line. 

It was certainly good enough to keep me on the hook through Genki 2, which I purchased in early February of 2021. At this point I was studying for one hour a day, as well as completing Anki reviews (which I'll talk about after this section), which led me to finish the Genki series (books 1 and 2) in 268 days, or 8.8 months.

## Anki

I started using Anki via. the open source AnkiDroid app for Android at roughly the same time that I started studying with Genki 1. It had been recommended from a random YouTube video I was watching on the topic at the time, and also from one of my friends who began studying at a similar time to me. To be honest, I can't quite remember the actual trigger that made me try it out, but I downloaded it, made a deck, and started adding cards from Genki's first lesson.

Originally, I tried using a pre-built "Top 2K Common Words" deck, but was quickly bored out of my mind. Here's the thing, for me, *Anki isn't fun*. I don't know if it's actually "fun" for anyone, it's quite a tedious process. The main enjoyment that I get out of Anki is seeing a card come up that I can remember the context and meaning for, and then immediately answer, which is an experience I would never have had with a premade deck (at least in my case), since I was just going through Genki and not consuming much of anything else.

I began adding words from the "vocabulary" sections of all the Genki lessons I was working through, and it worked out surprisingly well. Anki, for all of its faults (and there are a few) is a very effective memory tool, as advertised on the box. My original card limit was something like 10 new cards a day, however this quickly became 15, then 20, and now sits at 25 cards a day as I write this.

I don't see myself raising the limit any further, as I already have enough Anki review time as it is, but that is a comfortable amount for me, as I only make a very small subset of cards. Here are the types of cards in my deck:

- **Single word cards (Japanese -> English)**
If the word has a kanji form, then the kanji form is written on the front side of the card, and the hiragana reading is on the flip side.
- **Grammar sentence cards**
A single example sentence that uses a piece of grammar I'm trying to learn. On the reverse side is the English meaning of the sentence.

That's it. Yep, no sentence cards, no audio cards, no media at all in fact. For me, it works. I know many others in the community love to use sentence cards from the media they're consuming to learn new words via. Anki, but personally I've been using just single word translation cards & grammar sentence cards, and it's worked well for me thus far.

Obviously those types of cards on their own would be nowhere near sufficient to get you up to a high level of proficiency, but when was Anki ever supposed to be a main source of learning? At least personally, I see it as purely a supplement to whatever reading, watching or other form of consuming the language you're doing as well.

I'd like to share some Anki statistics with you all, but I'll wait until the wrap up at the end for that.

## Tobira

After finishing the Genki series of books, I was quite nervous about what I should continue doing afterwards now that I'd built up a bit of grammar and vocabulary knowledge. To that end, I spent a considerable amount of time researching what texbooks and other resources were available, whether this "immersion" thing that everyone and their dog was recommending was worth it, or whether I should just throw myself into the nearest river.

In the end, I chose Tobira.

Tobira is a textbook that is very unlike the first two Genki books, and likewise not too similar to the defacto follow-on from those books, Quartet, also published by the Japan Times. It is written entirely in Japanese (albeit with furigana, thankfully), and attempts to avoid using English within the book wherever possible, which was the main factor in my decision to use it as my follow-on from Genki.

It forces you to get accustomed to reading purely in hiragana and kanji, and if that's something you haven't done prior to starting the textbook, it can feel quite overwhelming. In my case, I found the first lesson quite difficult to work through having not really read much in purely Japanese before this point, however after working through a single lesson over a few days it became exponentially easier from then on to understand.

In addition to this, it also gives you lengthy passages from real texts as well as ones authored by the Tobira writers to test your reading and comprehension ability of the grammar that it taught you in the lesson preceding, which comes in a variety of genuinely interesting forms. For example, there is a lesson which has a manga section describing the invention of Cup Noodle, which I found quite amusing.

Had I continued on with Quartet or another majority English-based textbook, I suspect my Japanese reading skills would have been much worse off than they are now.

That isn't to say there aren't downsides to the textbook, one being that their grammar explanations compared to the Genki books felt quite lacking in substance. In the Genki series, you would get maybe a third to half a page per grammar point, explaining the basic usage, then nuances, and providing plenty of example sentences/diagrams to aid in understanding. In Tobira, you get an equation showing the correct form, a couple sentence explanation of the grammar point, and then two or three example sentences.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Tobira, however. The different stories and articles that were presented in each lesson were the first time in my Japanese textbooks that I was genuinely interested in reading the contents of the practice sections, rather than just for the sake of improving my comprehension.

I finished Tobira in 120 days, or 3.94 months.
