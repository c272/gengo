    <div class="post-content">
    <p>This year has been a very interesting (and productive!) year in terms of my Japanese learning, and certainly not one with a moment to spare. I progressed from being halfway through TOBIRA in January and finally reading my first Japanese novel, to in December having taken the JLPT N1 and reaching my goal of reading 52 novels this calendar year.</p>
<p>Here I’ll take the opportunity to look back over all of the content I consumed this year, and hopefully talk about some of both the standouts and letdowns. I’ll also present a portion of the interesting reading and immersion data I collected on myself this year, which should give you an idea of roughly how my time was split up, and in what (unfortunately embarassing) areas I invested far too much time into. Before this though, a quick, mostly complete overview of everything that I consumed this year.</p>
<p>In 2022, I –</p>
<ul>
<li>Read <strong>52</strong> Japanese books, a mix of fiction and non-fiction.</li>
<li>Listened to <strong>172</strong> podcast episodes.</li>
<li>Completed <strong>55</strong> series of anime.</li>
<li>Watched <strong>1084</strong> hours of YouTube in Japanese. <span style="font-size: 0.7em; color: #AAAAAA">(good lord…)</span></li>
<li>Played through <strong>11</strong> video games in Japanese, on PC and Switch.</li>
<li>Spoke for ~<strong>86</strong> hours in Japanese.</li>
</ul>
<p>While barely making my previous 新年抱負 of completing a book every week (it certainly didn’t help that I only started properly reading in March), I feel like on the listening front I definitely made progress I can be proud of. I can also definitively say that my speaking ability is in a much better place than it was at the beginning of this year, that being almost non-existant.</p>
<p>With our prelude out of the way, onto the main event, the books!</p>

<p>Here’s my lineup for my favourite books I read this year – and it’s fairly predictable if you’ve seen any of my reading reports over on <strong>日本語と英語</strong>. I’ve been on quite a 米澤穂信 binge this year, and ボトルネック is, in my opinion, the peak of his works that I’ve read thus far. A satisfying mystery setup, and a writing style which is very much to my tastes (although I admit, perhaps a Marmite situation) catapulted this to “top read of the year” status for me. If you read this, read it blind!</p>
<p>In addition, my entry at #2 is from an author I also have quite enjoyed this year, 住野よる. Starting from 君の膵臓をたべたい, his other work has been mostly excellent, and I enjoyed a fair few over the course of this year. This one follows the journey of a little girl who walks around the city after school meeting her many friends with a stray cat, and contains a very well thought out twist which ended the story satisfyingly. Definitely recommend.</p>
<p>Finally, we have 海の底, an entry from 有川浩, and one from their “giant weird natural phenomena” series, which has been excellent thus far. This work follows some giant crayfish which crawl from the ocean and trap our protagonists inside a cramped submarine, following the story of several characters in their rescue efforts. It was frankly brilliant, much as 塩の街 was, however this one had the edge for me.</p>
<p>Additional summary reviews of all of these books are detailed below in their individual entry, but those are the ones that stood out from the pack for me, and which deserved a little bit of extra detail.</p>
<p>With the cream of the crop complete, here is the top disappointment of the year for me, a head above all others as a spectacular letdown.</p>

<p>Yes, a book that was introduced to me as (and indeed is credited as) a literary classic, 金閣寺. I have a feeling I will probably catch a lot of flak for this, so don’t misunderstand – I don’t think the writing is bad. In fact, it’s <span style="font-size: 0.7em; color: #AAAAAA">(mostly)</span> pretty great in my opinion. I just could not get myself invested in the story whatsoever. No matter how hard I tried to lean myself into the story, it would inevitably enter another 5 page aside of yet another side-story, and completely lose my focus.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t have to physically force yourself to sit down and read a book, and in accordance to my wandering attention it took me almost 1½ weeks to finish this one alone, which had been unheard of for me the entire year.</p>
<p>I half wonder whether it’s just me that’s the problem. Am I just not <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty">intellectual enough</a> to understand 金閣寺? Maybe. Does that make it any less of a dissapointment to me than it was? Not really.</p>
<p>Now that we have the best and worst out of the way, let’s fill in the middle. Here are a collection of couple sentence reviews of every book I’ve read this year, along with a rating, in chronological order. Starting with the very first Japanese book I read…</p>

<p>The first book of the year I read, and honestly, I can’t remember much of the contents, so it didn’t make a huge impression. From what I do remember, the protagonist takes photos of their friend until their unfortunate early death, and it was fairly elegantly handled, although I had not read other books of this same trope yet. Decent read.</p>

<p>Another book in a slightly happier vein than the above - the two protagonists share a hobby of painting, however one initially appears cold and standoffish but is in fact carrying life baggage, et cetera. The perfect generic 角川文庫 book formula, from what I remember it was perfectly okay.</p>

<p>The first 誠深海 book that I read this year, and probably the second most enjoyable of the year. Follows the course of two students who drift away from each other growing up, with life seeming to keep them apart at every turn, left with an open ending. Definitely recommend a read.</p>

<p>The classic by 住野よる, and one I enjoyed quite a lot on first reading. Would definitely go into this blind though; if you’ve seen the movie, there’s probably no reason to re-read the novel unless you’re a big fan. This was the book that got me into reading the 住野よる backlog, so I am definitely glad that I did.</p>

<p>Entrypoint to the 古典部 series, and thus the start of the favourite series that I’ve read this year, and if you are interested in mystery novels or have seen the anime, I definitely recommend a read.

<p>The 代表作 of 森絵都, and certainly one that was a treat to read. It follows a grumpy (and fairly lazy) protagonist who finds that he has won the “rebirth lottery”, in which he is reborn into another body on death for a limited amount of time, and there is an incredibly well executed twist at the end which alone makes it worth reading.</p>

<p>A retelling of school-age mishaps and misbehavings of 村上龍, and one steeped in humour and charm. Combined with its writing style, this was one of the funniest books I read out of the lot this year, and I appreciated the latter half of this one immensely. Very memorable.</p>

<p>The second entry in the 古典部 series in which the club is tasked with solving a straight-to-DVD murder mystery that another class made for the school festival, and then lost the script for. As mysteries go, enjoyable standard volume in the series. Nothing particularly standout, just a solid entry, would recommend to series readers.</p>

<p>A more fantastical story compared to prior works by 新海 here, especially if comparing to something like 秒速５センチメートル. However, this doesn’t take away from the enjoyment of the book for me, despite not (in my opinion) reaching the highs of 言の葉の庭. If you’re a 新海 fan, you won’t be disappointed by this.</p>

<p>A strange story about a part-time convenience store worker who is obsessed with the processes and environment of the convenience store. Having worked there since coming out of education, she feels attached to the role however still tries to fit into society. Very interesting book and quite short, so recommend for a quick read.</p>

<p>The third entry in the 古典部 series, and one that relies more heavily on you suspending your disbelief. The low point of the series for me, however that is coming from someone who loves this series to bits, so of course I still think this is a perfectly good mystery book on its own merits. Read the other two first, though!</p>

<p>Another 冬野夜空 book after reading as my first ever Japanese book <em>一瞬を生きる君を僕は永遠に忘れない</em>.

<p>The fourth entry in the 古典部 series, and a collection of short stories this time compared to the prior 長編 volumes. This does make a change of pace, however all of the stories are excellent mini-mysteries, and the final title story alone is worth reading this for if you’ve preceded this by reading the prior volumes. If you’ve already got this far in the series, keep going! The best volume is yet to come.</p>

<p>A classic, and a classic for a reason. This follows our protagonist and the man he calls “先生”, and unlike my intense disappointment with reading other classics (namely 三島由紀夫), this one definitely lived up to the name. Something everyone should read at least once, even if just to tick it off the “obvious classics” list.</p>

<p>One of my top three, and for good reason. This describes the story of navy officers stuck protecting children in a docked submarine from an army of human-size crayfish which have appeared suddenly from the sea. The concept sounds absolutely insane, which it is, however it delivers perfectly on handling the disaster and character elements, and somehow doesn’t come off as corny. Absolutely a recommend if you have eyes for disaster novels.</p>

<p>Back-to-back 米澤穂信 books here, as I was on a run of really enjoying his novels in this portion, and <em>王とサーカス</em> is no different. Probably the strongest individual mystery novel of his that I’ve read thus far, and one that is also attached to a larger series of books surrounding the protagonist (although unlike 古典部 you need absolutely zero prior knowledge for this one). Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a good, solid mystery novel experience.</p>

<p>The one 新海 production that everyone and their grandma knows, and definitely the one that I’m the most lukewarm on. I feel like the movie version of this is probably great (I haven’t seen it mind you), however it comes across in novel form as just ‘perfectly <em>fine</em>‘, rather than anything particularly special. That isn’t to say it’s bad - I did read through the entire thing in one day! However a little letdown after seeing the amount of hype around the film. I should probably just watch the movie…</p>

A well-written mystery novel, and a fairly long one at that, one I recommend going into with as little pre-knowledge as possible (hence this rambling review).</p>

Many graphic descriptions of the protagonist becoming, as 三島 puts it, “<em>erectio</em>“, so perhaps not something for the weak hearted, however a book that I did come to see the charm of towards its closing portions. Worth a read for the “classic” status.</p>

<p>Interesting premise for this one - it is focused around the concept of “虚構推理” (wow, I know), the idea of using falsehoods dressed up in the coat of logical reasoning to deceive the masses into believing your point of view. However here, it is used as a tool in the arsenal of the “good guys”, including our protagonists, one of which has one eye and one leg. Definitely one to leave an impression, and I’d recommend, since there are a fair few volumes if it piques your interest.</p>

<h2 id="Anime-of-2022"><a href="#Anime-of-2022" class="headerlink" title="Anime of 2022"></a>Anime of 2022</h2><p>Anime for me this year has been a bit of a rollercoaster. Coming into the year I was just getting into and quite enjoying seasonal shows and watching through the backlog of classic anime I still had missing, however it burned out interest-wise for me around the end of October. From that point onward, I mostly switched to watching Japanese broadcast television (eg. 千鳥の鬼連チャン, IPPONグランプリ) and YouTube instead. However, out of the anime I did watch this year (which was still a fair amount, 55 shows), here are my top picks:</p>

<p>A double entry for Sunrise here, claiming both the top spots with their productions of Cowboy Bebop and Planetes. Frankly, there’s just something special about the shows they make (or rather, made around this time). The atmosphere, music choice, sound design, it’s all amazing, and I can’t give enough praise to these two shows. What clinches it with Bebop in the top spot for me is, of course, the awesome soundtrack provided by 菅野よう子 and the Seatbelts. Oh, and obviously because Ein exists.</p>

<p>That isn’t to put Planetes at shame, though. The worldbuilding and characters of that show on its own elevate it to #2 for me, and that’s without the epic soundtrack.</p>
<p>My pick for #3, Saiki, is definitely in stark contrast to the two above it. Wholly un-serious and not going for the artistic world building front whatsoever, instead aiming purely for fast-paced laughs. And it works, <strong>really</strong> well. The writing of this show can be stupid and over the top at times, but it’s justice to the creators of this show that I’ve watched most episodes three or four times by this point, and there never fails to be a joke which makes me spit take.</p>
<p>The pace of the show is so unrelentingly fast that even if a joke doesn’t land particularly well, it’s gone and dusted with the next joke being built up in a matter of seconds. The dialogue is also sometimes fast to the level of stupidity, and this definitely worked to developing my listening ability!</p>
<p>With the top out the way, here comes the bottom! The most unrelentingly garbage show I watched this year, and something I probably shouldn’t have picked up in the first place.</p>

<p>Lerche seemed to drop the entire budget for this show on the second to last episode’s fist fight animation, and then forgot to bother animating any of the rest of the episodes. I mean seriously, the amount of animation mistakes and sloppy&#x2F;robotic movement in this show was actually mind boggling. That, and also the plot adaptation was handled very poorly, at least according to the manga scholars that I am familiar with. The pacing felt jarring at times, and needless to say I won’t be back for the confirmed season 3 <span style="font-size: 0.7em; color: #AAAAAA">(no, seriously, they <a style="color: #AAAAAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/51180/Youkoso_Jitsuryoku_Shijou_Shugi_no_Kyoushitsu_e_3rd_Season">did that already</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Here is the entire list of shows I watched this year, although sadly not in chronological order since MyAnimeList is a bit weird, and refuses to save exact dates of when you started and ended shows past a certain time frame.</p>

However, I’ll note down here the ones that I did play, although most of these are yet to be completed. I won’t form a top three for these, as I feel it would be a bit useless considering the list isn’t that long either way.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-amp-Goals"><a href="#Conclusion-amp-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion &amp; Goals"></a>Conclusion &amp; Goals</h2><p>And that about wraps up my look back at all the immersion I did this year! If there is one thing absolutely positive about what I’ve done in the past 365 days, it would be that I have successfully completed my previous 新年抱負, which is something I definitely usually don’t get the pleasure of doing. I’m sure that’s a shared experience, right. Right?</p>
<p>Either way, now that this year is over, I want to look forward to the next 365 days of my Japanese learning journey, and decide myself some goals for what I should get done before the time for this post rolls around again next year. So, in the spirit of things, I’ll raise the stakes just a little bit on what I want to get accomplished. Next year, I will –</p>
<ul>
<li>Read at least <strong>53</strong> books. Can’t be standing still on this year, but I also don’t want to raise this one through the roof! I already read a lot.</li>
<li>Write <strong>something substantial</strong> in Japanese. Be it a series of blog posts, or a small creative work, or a video, I want to create something text-wise, because I haven’t <em>really</em> put any time into practicing that aspect of output.</li>
<li>Watch at least <strong>52</strong> shows. Be it anime, drama, or otherwise, I should get it back to consistency.</li>
<li>Pass the <strong>JLPT N1</strong>. This is admittedly kind of a cop-out, since I did take the exam in December, but in the event of a failure, I will re-take at the Summer JLPT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, I’m pretty happy with where my pace is at right now, and I don’t want to raise the bar so high that I trip and stumble, or even worse lose motivation entirely. At the end of the day, I’m doing immersion because it’s fun, and when that stops, the goals have to come back down. That being said, though, I’m confident I can at least hit most of these goals for next year, and I’m going to try and smash my book record by actually starting reading in January (what a thought, I know).</p>
<p>A very happy new year to everyone, and I wish everyone else luck with their new round of 新年抱負. 🎉</p>
